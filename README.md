# LÖVE 2D / LUA Workshop

I use this respository for some concepts I mess around with in the LÖVE 2D 11.0

## Agario rip off
Based on the game Agario. Procedurally generated word with endless food. Not online, no other players, I'm just interested in learning this language.

## Fading text
Cool fading text effect which transitions to different colours. This could be useful for different games. Again, I'm just learning the language.
